But this is almost never the case, in practice: it's far more likely for the agent to encounter a suboptimal (that is: worse than optimal) opponent.  \n\nSay the minimax agent encounters a suboptimal opponent. Should we expect the minimax agent to still play the game well, despite the contradiction with its assumptions?  If so, why?","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Solution:** We can still expect the minimax agent to perform well. On a high level, assuming an optimal opponent simply overestimates the opponent, but does not break the algorithm. The effect of overestimating the opponent is merely that the minimax agent will take longer to win, than if it had a more accurate understanding of its opponent. For instance, the minimax agent is highly unlikely to select the same column three times in its first three moves (since it assumes an optimal opponent that will certainly block the winning play in the next move), but this is not a bad initial strategy for playing against an agent that selects columns completely at random.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 5) Submit to the competition\n\nNow, it's time to submit an agent to the competition!  Use the next code cell to define an agent.  (You can see an example of how to write a valid agent in **[this notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/create-a-connectx-agent)**.)\n\nIf you decide to use the minimax code from the tutorial, you might like to add [**alpha-beta pruning**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning) to decrease the computation time (i.e., get the minimax algorithm to run much faster!).  In this case, \"alpha\" and \"beta\" to refer to two values that are maintained while the algorithm is running, that help to identify early stopping conditions.  \n\nWithout alpha-beta pruning, minimax evaluates each leaf node.  With alpha-beta pruning, minimax only evaluates nodes that could provide information that affects the agent's choice of action.  Put another way, it identifies nodes that could not possibly affect the final result and avoids evaluating them.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def my_agent(obs, config):\n    \n    ################################\n    # Imports and helper functions #\n    ################################\n    \n    import numpy as np\n    import random\n\n    # Gets board at next step if agent drops piece in selected column\n    def drop_piece(grid, col, piece, config):\n        next_grid = grid.copy()\n        for row in range(config.rows-1, -1, -1):\n            if next_grid[row][col] == 0:\n                break\n        next_grid[row][col] = piece\n        return next_grid\n\n    # Returns True if dropping piece in column results in game win\n    def check_winning_move(obs, config, col, piece):\n        # Convert the board to a 2D grid\n        grid = np.asarray(obs.board).reshape(config.rows, config.columns)\n        next_grid = drop_piece(grid, col, piece, config)\n        # horizontal\n        for row in range(config.rows):\n            for col in range(config.columns-(config.inarow-1)):\n                window = list(next_grid[row,col:col+config.inarow])\n                if window.count(piece) == config.inarow:\n                    return True\n        # vertical\n        for row in range(config.rows-(config.inarow-1)):\n            for col in range(config.columns):\n                window = list(next_grid[row:row+config.inarow,col])\n                if window.count(piece) == config.inarow:\n                    return True\n        # positive diagonal\n        for row in range(config.rows-(config.inarow-1)):\n            for col in range(config.columns-(config.inarow-1)):\n                window = list(next_grid[range(row, row+config.inarow), range(col, col+config.inarow)])\n                if window.count(piece) == config.inarow:\n                    return True\n        # negative diagonal\n        for row in range(config.inarow-1, config.rows):\n            for col in range(config.columns-(config.inarow-1)):\n                window = list(next_grid[range(row, row-config.inarow, -1), range(col, col+config.inarow)])\n                if window.count(piece) == config.inarow:\n                    return True\n        return False\n    \n    #########################\n    # Agent makes selection #\n    #########################\n    \n    valid_moves = [col for col in range(config.columns) if obs.board[col] == 0]\n    for col in valid_moves:\n        if check_winning_move(obs, config, col, obs.mark):\n            return col\n    return random.choice(valid_moves)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-01-10T14:29:17.882482Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-01-10T14:29:17.882857Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-01-10T14:29:17.900387Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-01-10T14:29:17.882816Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-01-10T14:29:17.899260Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":15,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Run this code cell to get credit for creating an agent\nq_5.check()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-01-10T14:29:09.678121Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-01-10T14:29:09.678584Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-01-10T14:29:09.689598Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-01-10T14:29:09.678551Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-01-10T14:29:09.688223Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":13,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"<IPython.core.display.Javascript object>","application/javascript":"parent.postMessage({\"jupyterEvent\": \"custom.exercise_interaction\", \"data\": {\"outcomeType\": 1, \"valueTowardsCompletion\": 0.2, \"interactionType\": 1, \"questionType\": 2, \"questionId\": \"5_JustSubmitEx3\", \"learnToolsVersion\": \"0.3.4\", \"failureMessage\": \"\", \"exceptionClass\": \"\", \"trace\": \"\"}}, \"*\")"},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Thank you for creating an agent!","text/markdown":"<span style=\"color:#33cc33\">Thank you for creating an agent!</span>"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import inspect\nimport os\n\ndef write_agent_to_file(function, file):\n    with open(file, \"a\" if os.path.exists(file) else \"w\") as f:\n        f.write(inspect.getsource(function))\n        print(function, \"written to\", file)\n\nwrite_agent_to_file(my_agent, \"submission.py\")","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Then, follow these steps to submit your agent to the competition:\n1.
